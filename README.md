### Description

I GUARANTEE this is the BEST custom scrollbar you will find here on PSC. Has 6 preset bevel profiles, 3 mouse states (Normal, Mouse Hover, and Mouse Down), and you may use pictures in place of each of them giving you endless possibilities. The code is not commented yet but I will get to it soon and reupload it when I'm done. But this code is VERY clean and easy to follow. Please vote, I worked very hard on this.
